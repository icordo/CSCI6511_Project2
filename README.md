# CSP Color Graph

Project Task: Develop a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) script capable of vertex coloring. This graph coloring consists of each vertex being assigned a color, without two adjacent vertices sharing the same color. 
Input: The input argument for this script would be a text file identifying the max amount of colors (C) to be used as well as all the coordinates (G) for all units being observed. 
Output: The output of this script should return an array identifying the correct color assignments (numbered 1-C, where C is the number of colors identified in the input) to the vertices.

# Usage (Main)

```python3 CSPColoring.py```

# Usage (Unit Test)

```python3 unit_test.py```
